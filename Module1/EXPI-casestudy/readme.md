**What domain of the financial industry is the company in?**

eXp World Holdings (NASDAQ: EXPI) operates primarily as a cloud-based residential real-estate brokerage, supported by its proprietary virtual workplace platform offering, designed to prioritize agents and brokers, across the U.S. and Canada.

**What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?**

Over the last 5-10 years, many of the major trends and innovations within real-estate, are consistent with secular shifts in technology across the overall global economy. The transformation of RE firms with physical brick & mortar operations, from paper driven processes to digital workflows, led to the adoption of cloud infrastructures and improved access to big data, industry-wide. 

These innovations positioned RE firms with physical brick & mortar operations to integrate 3rd party technology solutions across critical workflows, such as lead generation, customer relationship management, credit checks, security, property access, payments and employee training. 

In recent years, the most forward thinking residential RE brokerages have targeted machine learning and virtual reality/augmented reality technologies to boost efficiency and create operating leverage, capable of driving higher margins, while providing a superior customer experience. 

**What are the other major companies in this domain?**

eXp Worldwide represents a new class of residential RE brokerage companies with a top-down focus on technology to deliver a more favorable agent experience through higher revenue splits, signing bonuses and equity allotments, resulting in better overall productivity and competitiveness relative to industry peers. Redfin (NASDAQ: RDFN), and Compass (compass.com), represent other technology-focused peers, leveraging innovation to gain market share, from established players, most notably Keller Williams (kw.com), Berkshire Hathaway’s (NYSE: BRK.A) Home Services of America (homeservices.com), RE/MAX (NYSE: RMAX), as well as  Coldwell Banker (coldwellbanker.com) and Century 21(century21.com), both operating under the Realogy Brokerage Group (NASDAQ: RLGY).

## Results

Despite historically difficult operating conditions in 2020 due to mitigation efforts to address the global pandemic, eXp World Holdings continues to gain market share from traditional competitors, excluding Keller Williams.

## Recommendations 

**If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer?**

Currently, eXp World Holdings provides agents with access to a number of vetted third-party solutions through a newly launched marketplace for home buying services. The company should invest in the launch of its own app store, featuring internal solutions that seamlessly integrate with the company’s current workflows, thus optimizing the experience of the agents.

**Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?** 

eXp World Holdings is already positioned well ahead of the industry due to its technology driven approach, making it difficult to find partners that will match the current user experience provided to agents, as well as smaller brick and mortar residential RE brokerages that license their technology. By investing in these solutions now, they can maintain agent productivity from end-to-end, while launching new products that will provide a stronger technology moat and expand the company’s TAM.

**What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?** 

Virtual and augmented reality offerings to better support home buyers as they research new listings provided by the company. Machine learning to leverage big data for <i>instant cash offers”</i> to residential customers looking to sell property quickly. The implementation of blockchain technologies to reduce friction across underwriting, title & escrow, currency exchange, payments and compliance work flows, offers significant potential to boost operational leverage.

**Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?**

Many of these innovations already offer proven use-cases regarding the viability of the technology stack; yet, struggle for wide-spread adoption due to poor economics as a standalone solution or suffer from clunky forced UX-deficient integrations, further hindered by archaic processes.  eXp World Holdings is uniquely positioned to accept these technology stacks within its already validated and profitable, cloud-based brokerage business model and virtual workplace platform offering.
